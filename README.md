# GAN-NPC-Faces
Deep Convolutional Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) are increasingly used throughout the industry for various applications. Generating fashion articles, face editing, 3D object generation, and much more are all within the realm of DCGANs. After analyzing a specific dataset, the following paper implements the generation of random faces for Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) in video games.
